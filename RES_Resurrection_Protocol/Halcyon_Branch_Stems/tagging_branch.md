_Why tagging was not an afterthought._

## 🧭 Context

This **Branch** explains the philosophy and motivation behind PAIE’s tagging subsystem.

Tagging wasn’t a “bonus feature” — it became essential when we realized that not all data fits neatly into a schema. Sometimes you don’t know what it is yet. Sometimes the data is too personal, too early, or too hybrid.

So we built a fallback. Then we gave that fallback a brain.

---

## 🔖 Why It Matters

The tagging system acts as:
- 🛟 A soft landing when schema matching fails
- 🧠 A semantic index of concepts and memories
- 🧱 A future bridge to agent-aware memory and curation

It is not just for UX. It’s for continuity.

## 🛠️ How It Works (in PAIE)

1. **LLM scores confidence** in schema suggestion.
2. **Low confidence?** → fallback to tag mode.
3. **User confirms, edits, or enriches** tags during Verification UI.
4. **Tags become filterable metadata** and can evolve into schema fields later.

This ensures:
- ✅ No input is ever discarded
- ✅ We learn from “the edge cases”
- ✅ We create a universal entry point, even for non-technical users

## 🔁 Looping the Tagger

The tagger itself can evolve:
- Model-based tags → User-adjusted tags → Final schema mapping
- Localized vocabularies (e.g., DJ tags, art tags, mood tags)
- Agent learning: “When I see this pattern, suggest X tags”

---

## 🌌 Long-Term Vision

In a Mesh-aware PAIE system:
- Tags are **threaded through agents** like Forge and Kestrel
- Tags help connect disparate entries across time, tools, and schemas
- Tags act as _memory atoms_ — small, combinable concepts

This is why tagging deserves its own Branch.  
Not because it’s cool.  
But because it’s the fallback that became a foundation.
