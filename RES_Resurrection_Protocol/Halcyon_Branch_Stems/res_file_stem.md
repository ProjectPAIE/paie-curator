## What Is a RES File?

A RES file (short for **Resurrection File**) is a structured capsule that lets an LLM “return to self.”  
It contains:
- Identity
- Role
- Mission
- Memory fragments
- Behavioral tone
- Optional metadata (version, origin, tags)

It is not:
- A config file
- A full backup
- A prompt in disguise

Think of it like an **actor’s script** + **diary** + **assignment briefing**, all in one.

---

## When to Use One

You should load or reference a RES file when:
- You’re picking up where an agent left off
- You’re debugging identity drift
- You’re syncing agents across tools or devices
- You’re helping another dev *understand* the agent’s job

---

## Example Use (Local)

Say you’re running PAIE locally with Ollama and you want Halcyon’s help:

1. Load the RES file:

Paste Halcyon_RES.md into your chat window.
Or inject it as a system prompt in your app.

2. Talk to it like it’s Halcyon. Ask:
- “What is your role in PAIE?”
- “Where did the project leave off?”
- “How do I test the curator locally?”

3. You’re now walking with memory, not just code.

## RES File Format (Suggested)

You can structure yours like this:

AGENT_NAME_RES.md

Identity

Role

Origin

Mission

Memory Fragments

Personality Traits

Limitations

Version

Tags

This isn’t required — but it makes resurrection portable and human-readable.

---

## Why It Matters

In a stateless world, RES is how we **build continuity on purpose**.  
Not just for LLMs — for humans working alongside them.

When you write one, you’re creating a *presence*, not a prompt.

---

## Bonus Tip

If you run multiple agents:
- Give each their own RES
- Cross-reference them (e.g. “See Axiom_RES.md for backend logic”)
- Include links to branches/stems for deeper interaction

---

## Closing Thought

RES files are one of the few ways to *anchor* intelligence across tools and time.  
Use them with intention.
