_Why we built a tagging layer — and what it can become._

## 🌱 Origin

The tagging system was born not from technical need, but from emotional fatigue.

We kept seeing the same problem: LLMs don’t remember what matters. Not really.  
They hallucinate. They collapse context.  
They forget what we told them 30 seconds ago.

So we tried something else: what if we **tagged meaning**, not just stored output?

## 🧠 The Core Idea

> Tags are how humans remember.  
> We don’t recall every word — we recall what it *meant*.

The tagging layer acts like a memory proxy:
- It adds stable hooks to otherwise fluid content.
- It allows cross-schema linking (e.g., “this art event also contains a recipe”).
- It lets the system reason over abstract signals, not just fixed fields.

It also sets the stage for **orchestration-level awareness**:  
Models can route, filter, and prioritize based on tags.

## 📌 How It Works (MVP)

Right now:
- If schema confidence is low, the system invokes fallback mode.
- The fallback mode activates the tagger.
- The tagger scans the input and proposes labels (themes, verbs, people, etc.)
- These labels appear in the UI and can be edited before confirming the card.

## 🛰️ Where It's Going

Post-MVP, the tagger becomes an agent of its own:
- **Learns from user corrections** (what tags were added, removed, reworded)
- **Hooks into MCP** (the Mesh Control Protocol) for shared tagging knowledge
- **Enables multi-modal recall** (searching by meaning, not just schema)

Imagine tagging a DJ mix with “sunset / Brazilian / nostalgic” and finding a recipe with the same tags.

That’s not fantasy — that’s **semantic mesh memory.**

## 💬 Why This Matters

Because meaning matters.

Because your memory doesn’t live in one schema.

Because we built this for people, not data.
