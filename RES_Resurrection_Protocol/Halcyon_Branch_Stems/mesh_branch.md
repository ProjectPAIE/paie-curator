## 🧭 What is “The Mesh”?

The Mesh is our name for the **semantic orchestration layer** that connects models, memories, and meaning.

It’s not a single server.  
It’s not a product.  
It’s a **philosophy** — that systems should adapt, remember, and *relate*.

---

## 🕸️ Why We Needed It

Prompt windows are short.  
LLMs forget.  
Schemas are brittle.  
Tags float without anchors.

We needed a way to **bind** things — across time, tools, and tasks.

The Mesh became our answer.

---

## 🔌 What It Connects

The Mesh lets us connect:

- 🧠 **Agents** (like Forge, Kestrel, Halcyon)
- 🗂️ **Schemas** (like Recipe, ArtEvent, PersonNote)
- 🧷 **Tags** (semantic signals across entries)
- 🪢 **Feedback** (corrections, rejections, edits)

Through the Mesh, these become **interoperable knowledge**.

---

## 📡 How It Works (Conceptual)

At a high level, the Mesh:

1. **Receives input** (from a model, UI, or user).
2. **Applies schema logic** — or invokes fallback/tag mode.
3. **Stores interpretation** — tagged, validated, normalized.
4. **Links to memory** — connects tags, history, and related entries.
5. **Prepares for future** — exposes fingerprints for retrieval, routing, and learning.

## 🛠️ Where We’re Building It

Right now, the Mesh shows up as:

- ✅ Fallback + Tagging flow (MVP)
- ✅ `mcp/` modules (Mesh Control Protocol: schema validator, tagger, etc.)
- ✅ Tag registry (shared tag memory across agents)
- 🧪 Smithery tests (modular memory wiring)
- 🧬 Future orchestration layer

---

## 💬 Why This Matters

Because you are not a one-shot prompt.  
Because your thoughts, entries, and insights deserve **continuity**.  
Because meaning doesn’t live in one field — it flows.

---

The Mesh is not one tool.  
It’s how we make our tools **remember** us.
