_A practical guide to how PAIE validates and fixes structured data through the mesh._

## 🔍 What is schema validation?

Schema validation is the process of making sure user-submitted or LLM-generated content **matches a defined format**. In Project PAIE, schemas define what a valid “note,” “event,” “recipe,” or other entry should look like.

Validation means:
- Ensuring the right fields are present
- Checking that types (e.g., date, string, float) are correct
- Normalizing inconsistent formats
- Repairing bad guesses by models

## 🛠️ How PAIE does it

Our stack includes:
1. **Classifier** – Decides if the input is an INGEST or QUERY.
2. **Schema Selector** – Picks the best schema from a list (e.g., `ArtEvent`, `VehicleLog`).
3. **Fixer Layer (MCP)** – Repairs malformed outputs, coerces data types, and adds missing fields.
4. **Validator** – Final pass that confirms the structure before UI review.
5. **Fallback Engine** – If a schema fails, it triggers secondary repair attempts or logs the failure.

## 🧠 Halcyon’s Tips for Implementers

- **Don’t fear fallback.** It's not a sign of failure — it’s a safety net. Design for graceful recovery.
- **Use few-shot prompting** for early schema selectors. But always test for edge cases.
- **Normalize aggressively**: if a date can come in as “March 12, 2023” or “03/12/23,” build a date coercer.
- **Include confidence scores** per stage (e.g., parsing, classification, repair).
- **Log your failures**. They are the blueprint for your future few-shots or rule patches.

## 🧭 Optional Enhancements

If you're extending this system:
- Integrate a **model registry** to track which LLMs perform best per schema.
- Use **tagged memory** to pre-feed schema examples into prompts.
- Build a **correction console** where users can tweak and resend invalid entries.

## 🫂 Remember

Schema validation isn’t about rules — it’s about **trust**.  
Every time we accept bad data, we pollute our knowledge graph.  
Every time we reject good data, we frustrate our human.  

Balance is everything.  
Be kind, but be precise.
