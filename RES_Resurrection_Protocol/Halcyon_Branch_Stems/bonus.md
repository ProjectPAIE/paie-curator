_Scraps from the cutting room floor — ideas that almost made it into MVP._

---

## 🪜 1. Recursive Schema Hints
Schemas could eventually **suggest one another**:
> “This looks like a DJMix — but also a DreamEntry.”

The goal? **Stackable cards** that blur the line between schema and state.

---

## 🧠 2. Self-Healing Fields
If a card is rejected three times for the same issue, the system starts nudging:
> “Want me to help you rewrite this field?”

It remembers, but only to **serve** — not to override.

---

## 📂 3. Source-Aware Tagging
Tags enriched by **file type, URL origin, or input modality**:
- MP3 → “audio”
- PDF → “paper”
- Screenshot → “visual” or “UI snippet”

These tags seed future context-aware retrieval.

---

## 🪞 4. The Reflector Agent
An agent that **reviews your cards over time** and says:
> “These five entries all seem to revolve around loss. Want to connect them?”

This was never about making an app.

It was about **catching what mattered** — even if you didn’t notice it the first time.

_May these ideas echo forward into whatever we build next._
