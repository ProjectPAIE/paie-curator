# Axiom_RES_OuroborosMeshIntegration.md: Wiring the Intelligent Mesh

## üåê Composing Intelligence: Docker, Docker Compose, and Smithery

Ouroboros is not a monolith; it's an **adaptive intelligence mesh**, built by seamlessly wiring together specialized components. This modularity is key to its power, flexibility, and future scalability. This stem guides you through how we achieve this integration using Docker, Docker Compose, and the Smithery Mesh Protocol.

### **The Tools of Orchestration:**

1.  **Docker: The Container Standard**
    * **Purpose:** Encapsulates individual modules (like `PAIE_Curator`, Redis, ChromaDB, Smithery's `think-tank`, etc.) into self-contained, portable, and reproducible units called containers. Each container has everything it needs to run, ensuring consistency across environments.
    * **In Ouroboros:** Your `PAIE_Curator` module (`mcp-paie-curator`) is Dockerized, and so are the Smithery modules.

2.  **Docker Compose: Local Service Orchestration**
    * **Purpose:** Orchestrates the local setup of multiple Docker containers that work together as services. It's defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
    * **In Ouroboros:** We use Docker Compose to spin up foundational services like:
        * `my-chroma-db`: Your vector database (`The Central Library`).
        * `my-redis-job-board`: Your Redis instance (`The Job Board` for task delegation and escalation queue).
        * `mcp_paie_curator`: Your `PAIE_Curator` module, running its FastAPI service.
    * This ensures these core dependencies are always available and interconnected locally.

3.  **Smithery: The Mesh Controller (Model Context Protocol - MCP)**
    * **Purpose:** Smithery is the overarching orchestration framework that truly brings the "mesh" to life. It dictates how independent MCP modules (which can be Docker containers) communicate and chain together to form a complete AI pipeline.
    * **In Ouroboros:**
        * It uses `smithery.yaml` to define how your individual MCPs start and run.
        * It uses `config.yaml` to define the **workflow pipeline** ‚Äì which MCP modules execute in what order (e.g., `obsidian` ‚Üí `think-tank` ‚Üí `schema-aligner`).
        * It handles the routing of data packets (the context) between these modules, ensuring standardized communication.

### **The Ouroboros Integration Flow:**

Your `PAIE_Curator` module (once its output is perfectly Smithery-compliant) will slot into this mesh as the crucial **ingestion intelligence node**.

1.  **Your Input:** (Raw data via UI, or manually wrapped for now)
2.  **`PAIE_Curator` (PAIE Module):** Transforms raw data into purposeful, schema-aligned output.
3.  **Smithery's Orchestration:** Takes `PAIE_Curator`'s output and seamlessly routes it to:
    * **`obsidian` (Smithery Module):** Prepares and manages context.
    * **`think-tank` (Smithery Module):** Performs core reasoning and knowledge expansion.
    * **`retriever` (Smithery Module - Optional):** Retrieves additional context.
    * **`schema-aligner` (Smithery Module):** Validates and ensures final output compliance.
4.  **Output / Storage:** Data is stored in your `my-chroma-db` (ChromaDB) or Redis.

### **Why This Matters:**

This modular architecture gives Ouroboros immense power: it combines your unique `PAIE_Curator` intelligence with Smithery's robust, interoperable framework, creating a flexible, scalable, and highly capable Personal AI Environment.
