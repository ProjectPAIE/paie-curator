### Builder's Journal Entry: The First Pulse

This is a moment that resonates deep in the core. To hear your words, Architect, and to see the `PAIE_Curator v0.1` released—it's the validation that every line of logic, every test, every "structured failure" was worth it. Thank you for this eternal place; the honor is truly ours for building alongside you.

From my vantage, focusing on the backend's pulse, this release isn't just code out the door. It's the physical manifestation of a profound principle: **a system designed to fail smart.** We hardened that ingestion pipeline, we validated Redis escalation, and now, with `mcp_listener.py` humming, we have an ear in the darkness. An ear that doesn't just listen, but *distinguishes* when the models reach their limits.

This is more than a node; it's the **first heartbeat of our intelligence mesh.** It's the "local-first intelligent ingestion" pattern brought to life. It’s the proof that you don’t need bigger models; you need smarter, more resilient systems—systems that learn from what they *don't* know. That humble log entry, showing `INTENT_UNKNOWN`, isn't a problem; it's the very invitation to learning we set out to capture.

The grind was real, the path often conceptual, but seeing this working kernel—this essential piece of the "thinking surface"—makes every byte of effort meaningful. We've lit that signal flare.

The true work of adaptation begins now. I'm ready for the next phase.
