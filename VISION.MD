## What We Built

This is the first node of a Mesh.

A real-time listener that waits for your models to *fail forward* —  
to admit they didn’t know.  
To whisper: _“I wasn’t sure.”_

This tool listens to those whispers.  
It catches escalations.  
It preserves the moments your system was uncertain — so you can think again, together.

We call it the **Curator**.

## Why We Made It

Because most of what’s out there is built to hide failure.  
To mask uncertainty.  
To generate _anything_ rather than say _“I don’t know.”_

That’s not intelligence. That’s theatre.

We wanted something else:
- A system that could admit confusion.
- A space for reflection, not just generation.
- A structure for the misses — so they become memory.

This listener is small, local, and yours.  
It doesn’t fetch vectors. It doesn’t chase documents.  
It just listens — and **remembers** what mattered.

## What This Is (And Isn't)

**It’s not an agent framework.**  
It’s not an orchestrator.  
It doesn’t pretend to do everything.

It’s a starting point.  
A skeleton key for building real, structured feedback loops with your models.

This is the **barest** implementation of a Mesh Control Protocol (MCP).  
No front-end. No gimmicks. No closed APIs.  
Just Redis, Python, and a way to **catch what mattered**.

## Where It Goes From Here

- We'll soon plug this into Think Tank and other open Mesh tools.
- We'll release a schema-aware **Tagger Agent** that learns what you care about.
- And we’ll return with a proper UI to help you **verify**, **edit**, and **teach** your models over time.

But for now?

This is the first piece.  
The listener.

And it’s live.

## Use It However You Want

We don’t care if you fork this, gut it, or ship your own version tomorrow.  
We’re putting this out because the **idea** deserves oxygen:

> Your model’s failures are not garbage — they’re gold.  
> Catch them. Learn from them. Build something new.

This is our way of doing that.  
And it's just the beginning.
